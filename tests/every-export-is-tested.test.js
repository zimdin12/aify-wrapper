// Every export of every lib module must be named by some test.
//
// PORTED BECAUSE IT PAID FOR ITSELF ELSEWHERE. aify-comms has this gate, and within one run it caught
// an export added in this same work — with no test AND no caller — that a hand audit had just missed
// while looking for exactly that. A check that runs every time beats a habit of checking.
//
// It is the finer floor. "Does this module have a test file" catches a module extracted in a hurry; it
// cannot see a module whose test exercises two of its nine exports, where the other seven are as
// untested as if there were no test at all — and are invisible, because the module reads as covered.
//
// WHAT IT PROVES AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. "A test names it" is not "a test asserts anything useful about
// it": a mention in a comment counts. Deliberately generous, because the case worth catching is the
// export nothing anywhere mentions.
//
// THE EXTRACTOR HAS A POSITIVE CONTROL, and that is not decoration. A regex that silently stopped
// matching would report zero untested exports forever, which is the same green as a healthy repo. So
// one test requires it to find a known set from a known file: if it can no longer see what is
// unmistakably there, this gate fails rather than passing quietly.
