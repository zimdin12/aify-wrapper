// Run the suite with TEMP pointed at ONE directory, then delete that directory.
//
// THE LEAK THIS ENDS. Every test that needs a scratch directory calls `mkdtemp` and most never
// remove it, because a test that fails mid-way never reaches its own cleanup. Measured across this
// machine on 2026-09-02: 148 `aify-*` directories in the user's Temp from a single morning of suite
// runs, and roughly 50,000 before a disk-cleanup tool removed them. The prefixes name test scenarios
// -- `aify-damaged`, `aify-reinstall`, `aify-cwd` -- so this was never a shipped code path; it is
// test hygiene, and it filled a disk anyway.
//
// WHY REDIRECT TEMP RATHER THAN FIX EACH TEST. `os.tmpdir()` reads TMPDIR/TEMP/TMP at CALL time, so
// setting them here puts every `mkdtemp` inside this root -- in this process, in every test file, and
// in every child process any test spawns, including the launchers and daemons these tests start.
// Nothing in a test file changes, and forgetting to clean up stops mattering. Fixing the calls one
// by one would fix only the ones somebody remembered, and only until the next test is written.
//
// OLD ROOTS ARE PRUNED because a crashed or killed run never reaches its own teardown -- which is
// exactly the case that produced the pile. An hour is longer than any run here and short enough that
// a forgotten root does not survive the day.
